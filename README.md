#links
the only pages that exist are:
1. loading.html
2. home.html

#videos
need to reconvert video from new source sent to CG

#maps
currently using google maps
1. the number of hits may be a concern
2. using 'infoBubble' instead of 'infoWindow' or 'infoBox'
 1. infoWindow seems un-stylable
 2. infoBox seems to be deprecated
3. using 'Shades of Grey' for styling

#atom-molecule-organism
1. currently most of the CSS is under templates, this will probably move as I understand the structure better

looks like they used quite a bit of css 'magic' for this. will implement
also probably AJAX will be required with something like smoothstate.js
